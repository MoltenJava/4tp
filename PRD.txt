- Location access retrieval (with manual ZIP code entry alternative)
- Automatic fetching of elected representatives using Google Civic Info API
  
## Representative Profiles
- Comprehensive profiles for each representative including name, photo, title, party affiliation
- District information and contact details (email, phone, website, social media)
- Biographical information and committee assignments
  
## Activity Feed
- Recent votes with bill details, representative's position, and AI-generated summaries
- Upcoming legislation with expected voting dates and representative's projected stance
- Direct links to full bill text on congress.gov
  
## Notifications
- Customizable alerts for upcoming votes, passed legislation, and breaking news
- Per-representative notification settings for personalized updates
  
## Saved Representatives
- Ability to favorite and closely track specific representatives
- Dedicated "Watchlist" section for followed representatives
  
## Settings
- Location management and notification preferences
- Privacy controls and account management

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Politically engaged citizens seeking to monitor their representatives
- Civic-minded individuals who want to stay informed but lack time for extensive research
- Community organizers tracking legislative issues relevant to their causes

## Key User Flows
- Onboarding: Sign up → Location access → Representative discovery
- Daily check-in: View activity feed → Read bill summaries → Save items of interest
- Engagement: Receive notification → Review vote/bill → Contact representative
  
## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive interface prioritizing readability of complex information
- Simplified bill summaries in plain language for easy comprehension
- Mobile-optimized design for quick updates on the go
- Visually distinguishing representatives by party while maintaining neutral presentation

## APIs and Integrations
### Google Civic Information API
- Provides representative data based on geographic location
- Called during initial onboarding and when user updates location

### api.congress.gov
- Source for official legislative data
- Endpoints for member information, voting records, and bill details

### AI Summarization Service
- OpenAI API or custom model implementation
- Processes legislative text to generate concise, accessible summaries

## Infrastructure Requirements
### Frontend
- Swift/SwiftUI for native iOS development
- Combine framework for reactive programming
- LocationManager for geographic services
- Push notification implementation

### Backend
- Node.js/Express or Firebase Functions for API handling
- PostgreSQL or Firebase Firestore for data persistence
- Scheduled background jobs for API polling and data updates

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: API rate limits from Google Civic and Congress.gov APIs
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching strategy and background data refresh

- **Risk**: AI summarization accuracy for complex legislation
  **Mitigation**: Start with human-reviewed summaries for critical bills, implement feedback mechanism

- **Risk**: Data synchronization across multiple sources
  **Mitigation**: Establish clear update hierarchy and conflict resolution strategy

## MVP Concerns
- **Risk**: Scope creep extending development timeline
  **Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize features based on user value and development complexity

- **Risk**: User experience complexity due to dense information
  **Mitigation**: Focus on simplification and progressive disclosure of complex details

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited development resources for cross-platform support
  **Mitigation**: Focus on iOS excellence before expanding to other platforms

- **Risk**: Ongoing costs of AI summarization services
  **Mitigation**: Batch processing and implementation of local models where feasible
